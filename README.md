# vue-fiesta-todo
Proving a point that you can easily build a full stack project in minutes if you know your resources... without using a build pipeline or package manager. But don't. Because it's going to hurt in the end.

## Does this work?
Yep.

## Is it easy to work with?
Getting started? Yes.
Maintaining this? No, absolutely not.

## Are there lots of dev dependicies and a huge node_modules folder? 
Nope

## Getting started
Check this out. You ready? Clone this repo. Okay that was the hard part.

Open src/index.html

Ta-da! Full stack single page application backed by firebase.

## Should YOU do it this way?
No. No you should not. For example, hiding my password for firebase is very difficult. This is great for little projects and trying things out.
